All credits to `Tosha1409`'s code which helped me implementing this algorithm.<br>
# So what I observed 
**`Testcase.py`** contains 5 testcases with list of length 150,200,250,300,1000 and the benchmark results are store in the `python_result.txt` and `pypy3_result.txt` files. for benchmark I used `python or pypy3 -m cProfile`<br>
So using `pypy3` improved the running time for this program upto almost **85%** faster than python3 in this case and that is a very big difff!!
