'''
One of the most common examples of the backtracking is to arrange N queens on an NxN
chessboard such that no queen can strike down any other queen. A queen can attack
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The solution to this problem is also attempted in a
similar way. We first place the first queen anywhere arbitrarily and then place the next queen
in any of the safe places. We continue this process until the number of unplaced queens
becomes zero (a solution is found) or no safe place is left. If no safe place is left, then we
change the position of the previously placed queen.
